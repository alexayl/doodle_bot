config SERVO_TEST
	bool "Build servo test instead of main application"
	select SERVO
	help
	  When enabled, builds the servo test application instead of the main
	  doodle bot application. This allows testing the servo driver in isolation.

config SERVO_PWM_TEST
	bool "Build PWM test for servo pin debugging"
	select PWM
	help
	  When enabled, builds a direct PWM test to verify P0.12 pin output.
	  This helps debug servo connection issues by sending raw PWM signals.

config LED_TEST
	bool "Build LED test instead of main application"
	select LOCAL_LED_GPIO
	help
	  When enabled, builds the LED test application instead of the main
	  doodle bot application. This allows testing the LED driver in isolation.
	  Uses local LED driver instead of Zephyr's built-in driver.

config BUZZER_TEST
	bool "Build buzzer test instead of main application"
	select BUZZER
	help
	  When enabled, builds the buzzer test application instead of the main
	  doodle bot application. This allows testing the buzzer driver in isolation.

config PWM_BUZZER_TEST
	bool "Build PWM buzzer volume control test"
	select PWM
	help
	  When enabled, builds the PWM buzzer test application for volume control.
	  This test demonstrates how to control passive buzzer volume using PWM duty cycle.

config PWM_BUZZER_DRIVER_TEST
	bool "Build PWM buzzer driver test"
	select PWM
	help
	  When enabled, builds the PWM buzzer driver test application.
	  This test demonstrates the full PWM buzzer driver with volume and frequency control.

config STEPPER_TEST
	bool "Build stepper test instead of main application"
	select DOODLE_STEPPER
	help
	  When enabled, builds the stepper test application instead of the main
	  doodle bot application. This allows testing the stepper driver in isolation.
